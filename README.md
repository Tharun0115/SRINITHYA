## Setup & Configuration

Since this is a static website, no backend server is required. You can host it on GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or any standard web server.

### 1. EmailJS Configuration

To make the "Request a Quote" form and the "Send Estimate" feature work, you need to configure EmailJS:

1.  Sign up at EmailJS.
2.  Create a **Service** (e.g., Gmail).
3.  Create an **Email Template** for inquiries and quotations.
4.  Open the HTML files (`index.html` and files in `Product_details/`) and look for the following script block in the `<head>` or script section:

    ```javascript
    (function(){
        emailjs.init("YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY"); 
    })();
    ```

5.  Replace `YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY` with your actual Public Key.
6.  In the `sendPdfByEmail` function and form submission listeners, replace `YOUR_SERVICE_ID` and `YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID` with your specific IDs from the EmailJS dashboard.

### 2. Dependencies (CDNs)

The project relies on the following external libraries loaded via CDN. Ensure you have an internet connection for these to load:

-   **Tailwind CSS**: For styling (`cdn.tailwindcss.com`).
-   **Font Awesome**: For icons (`cdnjs.cloudflare.com`).
-   **jsPDF**: For generating PDF quotes (`cdnjs.cloudflare.com`).
-   **jsPDF-AutoTable**: For creating tables in PDFs (`cdnjs.cloudflare.com`).
-   **EmailJS**: For sending emails (`cdn.jsdelivr.net`).

## Customization

-   **Colors**: The primary and secondary colors are defined in the Tailwind config script within the `<head>` of each HTML file:
    ```javascript
    colors: {
        primary: '#1e3a8a',   // Dark Blue
        secondary: '#d97706', // Amber/Orange
        dark: '#111827',      // Almost Black
    }
    ```
-   **Adding Products**: To add new products, duplicate an existing product card HTML block in the relevant `Product_details` file.
    -   Ensure you update the `data-*` attributes (e.g., `data-model`, `data-power`) if the page supports the "Compare" feature.
    -   Update the `addToCart` function arguments with the new product details.
